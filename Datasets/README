#Datasets used for our project

To visualize molecules:
Files used: All files used on project
1) Load files in VMD
2) Click on Graphics -> Reprensentations
3) Use the following settings:
    To visualize secondary structures:
    - Selection: all
    - Color Method: Secondary
    - Drawing Method: New Cartoon (or Points)
    
    Create a new representation (in addition to the one above) if you want to visualize water molecules:
    - Selection: water
    - Color Method: ColorId - 9 (Pink)
    - Drawing Method: Beads (or Points)

To visualize Ramachandran Plots:
Files used: 1RUZ.pdb, 1NN2.pdb, 6VXX.pdb
1) Load files in VMD
2) Click on Extensions -> Analysis -> Ramachandran Plot
3) Change the molecule selected by clicking on the box next to "Molecule:" and select the number assigned to the molecule you want

To create RMSD graph:
Files used: 1RUZ.pdb, 1NN2.pdb, 6VXX.pdb
1) Load files in VMD
2) Click on Extensions -> Analysis -> MultiSeq
3) On the MultiSeq window, filter out any nuclear data for hemagglutin, neuraminidase, and spike protein by highlighting them and clicking the "Delete" button on your keyboard.
4) Now click on Tools -> Stamp Structural Alignment and click on "OK" on the window popup. This will align the molecules on the MultiSeq window.
5) Click on Tools -> Plot Data. On the popup window, click on the RMSD radio button, then click "OK". The RMSD plot should appear.
